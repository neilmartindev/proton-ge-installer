# proton-ge-installer
Automated Proton GE installer and updater for my Manjaro machine.

It queries the latest Proton-GE install and unpacks it to home/.steam/steamapps/compabilitytools.d. You'll still have to restart Steam but there is a check to see if you have the latest version already and it prints out the latest changelog.
