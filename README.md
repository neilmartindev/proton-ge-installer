# proton-ge-installer
Automated Proton GE installer and updater for arch based machines. This was tested on Manjaro, so no other testing had been done on other distributions.

It queries the latest Proton-GE install and unpacks it to home/.steam/steamapps/compabilitytools.d. You'll still have to restart Steam but there is a check to see if you have the latest version already and it prints out the latest changelog.
